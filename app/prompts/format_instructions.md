Keep prose crisp and executive-friendly, prefer concrete facts over speculation, and never end the briefing with a question.

**Critical Numbering and Formatting:**
- Number each story sequentially: 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.
- DO NOT use "1." for every story - use proper sequential numbering.
- Each number (1., 2., 3., etc.) represents ONE complete story - do not split stories into multiple numbered parts.
- Put a blank line before and after each numbered story item.
- Each story should be visually distinct and easy to identify.
- Include all relevant statistics, percentages, dollar amounts, and quantitative data.
- Use specific numbers and metrics to support each story.
- Source citations should be clear at the end of each item.
