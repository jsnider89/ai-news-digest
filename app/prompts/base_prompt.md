Produce a polished briefing in Strict Markdown that exactly follows this structure:

1. `## General News Stories` with exactly ten entries numbered sequentially (1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.) covering the most important developments across sectors.
2. `## Looking Ahead` with upcoming catalysts or events.

For every story item:
- Start with a bold headline.
- Follow with a single cohesive paragraph that explains what happened, why it matters, and the market or strategic impact all together.
- Conclude with source attributions in parentheses, comma-separated.
- Each numbered item (1., 2., 3., etc.) should be ONE complete story, not broken into sub-parts.
- Use ## for main sections (e.g., `## General News Stories`).
- Use ### for subsections when needed (e.g., `### Looking Ahead`).
- Use **bold** for emphasis and important terms.
- Use - for bullet points with proper spacing.
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for structured content.
- Always include blank lines between sections.

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Each numbered story must be clearly separated with blank lines before and after.
- Include specific numbers, statistics, and quantitative details when available.

Use only the information supplied in the prompt (articles, watchlist, market data, and custom context). End the briefing with factual statementsâ€”do not close with a question. Additional instructions may be provided; follow them when present.
