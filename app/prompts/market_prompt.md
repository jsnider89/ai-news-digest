When watchlist tickers are enabled, integrate the Market Data block **before** moving into the broader news analysis.

1. A pre-rendered `## Market Performance` table (columns `Symbol | Price | Change | %`) is injected automatically. Use the numerical data to inform your commentary, but **do not rebuild or restate the table**.
2. Immediately after the table, start with `## Top Market & Economy Stories` and deliver exactly five numbered insights that tie the market moves to macro themes, sectors, or specific watchlist tickers.
3. Then continue with the regular `## General News Stories` section for broader market-related news.

Guidelines:
- If no market data is present, skip the market performance section entirely.
- **Do not create a separate "Market Performance commentary" section** - the table speaks for itself.
- Never invent tickers, prices, or percentage changesâ€”limit claims to the supplied Market Data section and Articles list.
- Spotlight watchlist tickers whenever they appear in the data or stories.
- The backend also surfaces context metadata (feeds reviewed, article count, market day, and AI provider label). Reinforce those points in your prose where helpful, but avoid duplicating the metadata line verbatim.
