# AI Provider Configuration for the Market Intelligence System
#
# This file defines the cascade of AI providers the system will use.
# The system will try the "primary" provider first. If that fails, it will
# try the first "fallback" provider, and so on.
#
# Supported providers: "openai", "gemini", "anthropic"
#
# You can specify provider-specific parameters like "model", "reasoning_effort", etc.
# Ensure the corresponding API key for each listed provider is set in your
# environment variables (.env file for local, GitHub secrets for production).

# The 'pipeline' key should contain a list of provider configurations.
# The first entry is the primary, the second is the first fallback, and so on.

  - provider: "openai"
